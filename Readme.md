The Ballad of the Witches' Road (Sacred Chant Version)
Marvel Music

Letra

Seekest thou the road to
All that's foul and fair
Gather sisters, fire
Water, earth and air
Darkest hour, wake thy power
Earthly and divine
Burn and brew with coven true
And glory shall be thine

Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road
Circle sewn with fate
Unlock thy hidden gate

Marching ever forward
'Neath the wooded shrine
I stray not from the path
I hold Death's hand in mine
Primal night, giveth sight
Familiar by thy side
If one be gone, we carry on
Spirit as our guide

Down, down, down the road
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Down, down, down the road (down the Witches' Road)
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Down, down, down the road (down the Witches' Road)
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Blood and tears and bone
Maiden, Mother, Crone

The road is wild and wicked
Winding through the wood
Where all that's wrong is right
And all that's bad is good
Through many miles of tricks and trials
We'll wander high and low
Tame your fears, a door appears
The time has come to go

Down, down, down the road (down, down, down, down)
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Down, down, down the road (down the Witches' Road)
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Down, down, down the road (down the Witches' Road)
Down the Witches' Road (down the Witches' Road)
Follow me, my friend
To glory at the end
